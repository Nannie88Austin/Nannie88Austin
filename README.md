## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a backend developer with a strong focus on building reliable, scalable systems using Django and Celery. I specialize in developing asynchronous, event-driven architectures that handle background tasks efficiently while keeping APIs responsive and user-friendly.

Django provides a solid, high-level framework that allows me to move quickly while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase. Paired with Celery, it becomes a powerful tool for handling tasks like sending emails, processing files, or integrating with third-party services without blocking the main application flow. Iâ€™ve worked on systems where reliability, fault tolerance, and performance are essentialâ€”and Celery has been key to making those systems run smoothly at scale.

This repository is a space where I share projects, templates, and patterns that I use in real-world Django applications. Youâ€™ll find asynchronous task queues, retry logic, scheduling, and monitoring toolsâ€”all configured to work seamlessly with Djangoâ€™s ORM and admin interface. I also explore integrations with tools like Redis, RabbitMQ, and Flower to support robust task execution and visibility.

Beyond functionality, I care about clean architecture, modular design, and writing code that's easy for teams to maintain and extend. Whether you're building a task-heavy web application or simply want to offload certain processes from your API, I hope these resources provide a helpful starting point.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore the projects, raise issues, or start a discussion. Whether youâ€™re new to Celery or have been working with Django for years, thereâ€™s always more to learnâ€”and Iâ€™m excited to be part of that journey.
